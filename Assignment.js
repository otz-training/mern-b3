/*
     Assignment Operator :
     - Binary operator
     - It assigns RHS operand to LHS operand
     - x=9;
     - Here LHS operand must be a container i.e variable
     - RHS operand can be a literal/constant , variable,or an expression.
     - Example:
       4 =10 ;//Error

       let x = 11;
       let y = x;
       let z =  x*y;

     - There are two types of assignment operator used in JS.

       1. Simple Assignment 
          =

       2. Comound Assignment

          +=
          -=
          *=
          /=
          %=

         Example:

         let x=5;
         console.log(x);//5
         x+=12; // x = x+12;
         console.log(x);//17
